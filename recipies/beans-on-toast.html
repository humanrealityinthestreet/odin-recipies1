        <h2>Did you know that beans on toast is a dish fit for a Queen?</h2>
        <p>a late-night snack, a light supper or even a quick snack, beans on toast makes an ideal comforting meal when what you need is something warm in your stomach.</p>
        <p>Another excellent reason to love this simple, hearty dish is that it is very gentle on the wallet.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tin of Heinz beans (made in England)</li>
                <li>3 slices of bread</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the beans into a small pot over medium low heat.</li>
                <li>Put the bread in the toaster, and make the toast as desired. (If you like, you can butter the toast, but I find it unecessary as the beans are the primary flavor.)</li>
                <li>Stir the beans, and heat until almost boiling, but don't allow to boil. (According to directions on the tin, this will affect the flavor.)</li>
                <li>Place the toast on plates, and spoon â…“ tin of the beans over the top of each slice. Serve immediately, preferably with a cup of hot tea.</li>
            </ol>
